        "explanation": "This is an extremely long explanation designed to demonstrate the new error handling feature. Telegram has a character limit for explanations, which is 200 characters. If this text, combined with Markdown formatting, exceeds that limit, the bot will first try to send the poll. If it fails with a 'Message is too long' error, the bot will automatically try again, but this time without any explanation at all, ensuring the poll is still delivered to the users instead of being skipped. This makes the bot much more resilient to content-related errors and prevents the loss of questions."
